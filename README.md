Encapsulation:
Use of private, public, protected to control access.


Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features.
Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.


Inheritance:
One class can acquire the properties and behaviors of another class.
Achieved with extends (class-to-class) and implements (class-to-interface).

Polymorphism: Same method name but different implementations.
Types:
Compile-time (method overloading) → same method name, different parameters.
Runtime (method overriding) → subclass provides a new version of a method from parent.
